I had trouble configuring the package such that the Dictionary.txt file would
appear automatically in the referencing project's output folder, next to the .dll.

It's set to Content, Copy if newer in Daves.WordamentSolver which makes sense, but in
the .csproj I also set <Pack>false</Pack> to prevent the file from being included in
the root directory of referencing projects.

Then I use Visual Studio to build the .nupkg, change the extension to .zip, unzip, edit
the .nuspec to look something like this (note the <files> tag; that gets added by hand):

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<package xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2012/06/nuspec.xsd">

    </dependencies>
  </metadata>
  <files>
    <file src="build\**" target="build" />
  </files>
</package>

Then I add that build folder (at the same folder level as the .nuspec), and it contains
the Dictionary.txt file and a file called Daves.WordamentSolver.targets with these contents:

<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <ItemGroup>
    <None Include="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)Dictionary.txt">
      <Link>Dictionary.txt</Link>
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </None>
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>

Then zip the ~6 things in the unzipped folder again and change the extension back to .nupkg.
